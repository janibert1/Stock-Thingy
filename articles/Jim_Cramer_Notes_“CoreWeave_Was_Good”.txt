CoreWeave, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWV) is one of thestocks that Jim Cramer spoke about. Answering a caller’s query about the company during the lightning round, Cramer said:

“Look, I think CoreWeave, I gotta tell you, CoreWeave was up 11 today, CoreWeave was 11. I think CoreWeave was good. Remember, NVIDIA’s better than CoreWeave. I think CoreWeave might even tell you that.”

CoreWeave (NASDAQ:CRWV) provides a cloud platform optimized for GenAI workloads, as it provides compute, storage, networking, and managed services. The company’s tools support AI model training, inference, rendering, and dataset optimization for enterprise-scale deployments. When a caller inquired about the stock during the July 21 episode, he responded:

“Alright, I think I like CoreWeave and I like Michael Intrator, but I would say the stock is $60 billion, and it’s going to have to come down and cool off a little bit. There are too many shorts in it. The shorts are covering right now. Once they’re finished covering, I think the stock does drop, and you can take a look at it.”

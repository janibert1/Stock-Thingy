Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of theAI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Street.On July 30, Jefferies analyst Edison Lee reiterated a Hold rating on the stock with a $188.32 price target

According to the analysts, Apple may increase prices for the upcoming iPhone line-up due to strong second-quarter demand and increasing cost pressures.

“We saw more evidence of strong iPhone demand in 2Q25, as key US telcos reported ~22% growth in equipment sales in 2Q driven by pull-in, the highest in the last 6 Qs. So CP/IDC’s reported growth (4%/1.5%) may be an under-estimate. Separately, we expect a US$50 selling price hike for iPhone 17 Slim/P/PM to offset higher component costs and China tariff. Others such as India tariff, sectorial tariff and lower yield in India are not yet covered.”

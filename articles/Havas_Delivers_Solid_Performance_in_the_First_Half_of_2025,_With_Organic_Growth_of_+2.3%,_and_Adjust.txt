Europe (50% of net revenue):after a better performance in the second quarter of 2025 compared to the first quarter (net revenue up 2.6% in the second quarter, down 0.2% in the first quarter), organic growth in net revenue came out at 1.3% for the first half of 2025 in Europe. Both France (Havas Creative with BETC mainly) and the United Kingdom (strong performance of Havas Media notably), which are Havas’ main markets in Europe, performed well in the second quarter of 2025, compared with the second quarter of 2024.

North America (35% of net revenue):organic growth in net revenue accelerated significantly in this region to 4.6% in second quarter 2025, compared to second quarter 2024. This excellent performance was driven by the Havas Health business line, whose double-digit organic growth accelerated in the second quarter versus first quarter 2025. As a result, organic growth in North America came out at a solid 3.9% for the first half of 2025. For reminder, the basis comparison for the North America region was -6.4% organic growth for the first half of 2024.

APAC & Africa (9% of net revenue):this region experienced a negative performance in second quarter 2025, mainly due to less client spending in China. In first half 2025, net revenue was down 1.8%.

Latin America (6% of net revenue):after several quarters of sustainable growth, the Latin America region recorded a slowdown in second-quarter 2025 compared to first-quarter 2025.

The amount of the share capital of Havas NV immediately before and after implementation of the reverse share split will remain unchanged because, the nominal amount of each share composing the share capital of Havas NV, after the implementation of the reverse split, will be 2 euros per share, compared with 0.2 euro per share before the reverse split.

Note on Operating Cash Flow before working capital:

As from July 29, 2025, Havas will report its Operating Cash Flow before working capital, a non-IFRS measure defined in the above financial glossary ("OCF before WC"). This new figure will be provided going forward in addition to Free Cash Flow ("FCF" – defined as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures). Management believes OCF before WC provides more relevant information on Havas’s underlying cash generation capacity compared to FCF, as OCF before WC does not take into account short-term, external or seasonal fluctuations in Havas’s working capital requirements. In the first half of 2025, OCF before WC amounted to 117 million euros, up from 104 million euros in the first half of 2024. In the first half of 2025, Free Cash Flow stood at (73) million euros, compared to (99) million euros in the first half of 2024.

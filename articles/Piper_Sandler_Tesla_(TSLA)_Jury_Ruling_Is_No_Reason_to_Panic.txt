Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of theAI Stocks Analysts Are Watching Closely.On August 4, Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter reiterated an "Overweight" rating on the stock with a $400.00 price target.

The firm said investors shouldn’t be over-reacting to headlines surrounding Tesla’s recent Autopilot-related jury verdict in Florida. It believes the case is less significant than it seems.

“In our years covering TSLA, we’ve learned to ignore headlines related to Autopilot liability. But the robotaxi roll-out has breathed new life into this topic, and we feel compelled to comment on recent media intrigue. On Friday, when a jury in Florida found Tesla partially liable for a 2019 crash, headlines began proliferating, referring to a “stunning rebuke”, a “massive blow”, and a $243M obligation. In our view, these headlines paint an unrealistically negative picture. In short, we don’t think shareholders should be losing sleep over this.”

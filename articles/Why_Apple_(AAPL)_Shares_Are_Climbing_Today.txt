Although exact details remain under wraps, the anticipation alone sent shares of Apple trending higher as traders positioned ahead of the official statement expected later in the day. The move suggests Apple may be responding to growing pressure from both political and supply chain angles to localize more of its hardware production.

This comes as policymakers in the U.S. are still urging tech firms to bring production back to the U.S. to depend less on foreign suppliers located abroad or in Asia. Apple is already producing part of its products under domestic assembly, but this may be a greater sign of commitment to American production.

Investors consider Apple's potential expansion in the U.S. a good omen for long-term growth, cost control, and the ability to withstand negative forces. Although the deal is not yet fully confirmed, optimism concerning Apple's revival of investments back home has already weighed on the market.

Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of theAI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Street.On July 31, Wolfe Research analyst Emmanuel Rosner reiterated a “Peerperform” rating on the stock without a  price target.

According to the firm, near-term Street estimates for the stock appear high, particularly for 2025 and 2026. Free cash flow is also likely to remain under pressure even though the company’s energy business could be a vital factor.

“TSLA shares are down 21% YTD, below the broader S&P up 8% and RIVN down 2%, with Ford up 9% and GM down 2%. Near-term, Street estimates still appear high, especially for 2025 and 2026. And FCF is likely to remain under pressure, with strong growth in the company’s burgeoning Energy business a key swing factor. That said, this name trades more around the narrative than the numbers. “

Nevertheless, the firm tactically sees an improving narrative.

“Tesla has several catalysts coming w/r/t FSD and robotaxi, including an expansion of their AV service into several new US markets (San Francisco, Nevada, Arizona, Florida, etc). The company plans to unlock hands-free / eyes-off autonomy for FSD owners in select US locations by YE25. Supervised FSD in China and Europe is expected to launch over the next ~12 months. And Optimus is expected to enter scale production in 2026.”

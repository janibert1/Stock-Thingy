The White House saying the iPhone maker will boost its US investment commitment by $100 billion. The White House says that President Trump will make that announcement today. It's the latest pledge by the tech giant to increase US production of its products as it seeks to avoid tariffs on its flagship iPhones. Earlier this year, remember, Trump warned that he would hit Apple with a tariff of at least 25% if it did not move manufacturing of the iPhone to the US. The company has previously announced it plans to spend $500 billion in the US over the next four years. Right now, the share is moving a little bit higher. Of course, we've also heard estimates from many different analysts about how much this could potentially boost the cost of an iPhone if they are largely made in the United States. So we'll see how this all plays out, what timeline we get from Apple in terms of increasing that investment in the US, and exactly what it looks like. So still a number of questions, some of which may be answered as part of the president's announcement today.

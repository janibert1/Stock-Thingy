Investing.com -- Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock rose 1.25% in pre-market trading Wednesday following comments from National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett suggesting the tech giant is likely to announce a new factory in the United States.

During an interview on Fox Business, Hassett indicated that a significant Apple announcement could be imminent. "We’ve got trillions and trillions of dollars of commitments for people to build new factories here. In fact, you’re likely to see one today from Apple," Hassett stated.

The potential factory announcement comes amid the administration’s ongoing efforts to boost domestic manufacturing. Hassett’s comments were made during a broader discussion where he emphasized that President Trump’s highest priority is to ensure economic data reliability and Federal Reserve independence.

While discussing other economic matters, Hassett also addressed questions about the Federal Reserve, noting that the Fed board "seems to be voting in a partisan way." When asked about a potential Fed position for himself, Hassett responded that he would be "happy to talk about the challenge."

The timing and specific details of Apple’s potential factory announcement remain unclear, though Hassett’s comments suggested it could come as early as today. If confirmed, this would represent a significant manufacturing investment by Apple in the United States.

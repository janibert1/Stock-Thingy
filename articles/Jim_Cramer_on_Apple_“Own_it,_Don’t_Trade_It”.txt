Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of thestocks that Jim Cramer spoke about. During the episode Cramer discussed the company’s earnings and he commented:

“Now, we also heard from Apple, whose sales and earnings came in substantially better thanks to surprisingly strong iPhone sales. Even though Chinese business improved, people always want to write off, Apple’s a no-growth company, best days behind them. But they just put up 10% revenue growth. A reminder that this remains one of the greatest companies on earth. You know what I say? Own it, don’t trade it.”

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) designs and sells smartphones, computers, tablets, wearables, and accessories. The company also provides cloud, support, and digital content services. Cramer mentioned the company in a June episode. He remarked:

“Apple’s pulling off something amazing, moving about 20% of their iPhone manufacturing to India, but the rest are still coming from China. Still, the White House doesn’t care. They want those phones made in America, so they’re threatening a 25% tariff on the ones from India… What a shame. Apple is a huge employer in China, and China’s a huge market for Apple, but the White House is making them leave, and they’re not even getting any credit for it.
